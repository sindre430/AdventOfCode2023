# Advent of Code 2023

Advent of Code is an annual coding event designed by Eric Wastl. It consists of a series of fun and challenging programming puzzles released daily during the month of December. These puzzles cover a wide range of algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques, making it an excellent opportunity for developers to enhance their coding skills in various programming languages.

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges. Each day's puzzle has its own folder, containing code files and any necessary resources to solve the problem.

Join the coding adventure at [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023)!
